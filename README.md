# Factor Authentication System Using Arduino

## Abstract
Securing systems and protecting sensitive data is crucial today. Traditional single-factor authentication like passwords or access cards is vulnerable. This project implements a robust two-factor authentication system using Arduino Uno. It combines: something you know (PIN code) and something you have (RFID card). Integrating these three factors enhances security over single or two-factor methods.

## Use Case
- Financial institutions
- Data centers
- Personal safes
